    Human Trafficking has been on the rise around the world. The trade of human beings for forced labour and sexual 
    exploitation. Agencies such as <a href="https://www.antislavery.org/"> Anti-Slavery International </a>, 
    <a href="https://polarisproject.org/"> Polaris Project </a> and <a href="https://www.urban-light.org/"> Urban Light </a>
    work at both the local and international level to stop Human Trafficking. It is estimated that nearly 600,000 - 800,000 
    people are trafficked across the borders every year. Both the US and European Union gave an estimated 65 million USD to
    projects aimed at ending human trafficking, yet the amount of human trafficking cases are rising.

    Fortunately, known actors, such as Ashton Kutcher, are using their position, role, and success to invest in 
    projects to aid those victimized by human trafficking. As we all know, it is crucial to raise awareness about epidemics 
    and issues that are in effect on a global scale. With your help we can end human trafficking!
